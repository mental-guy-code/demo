Because biological phenomena are complex and changeable, gene expression regulation is diverse, and there are various modifications after gene transcription or translation, the study of single omics will inevitably lead to the loss of genetic information, resulting in incomplete conclusions. Therefore, the study of single omics has important defects. In recent years, intermediate molecular phenotypes (transcriptome, metabolites, etc.) have been widely used in the study of human disease multiomics. Multiomic association analysis has widely revealed the molecular mechanism of human disease formation.
